								<p>This work presents the design of a 64-channel double-rowed head coil (16 octagons with 4 Tx channels on each octagon). The magnetic field (B1+) and the specific absorption rate (SAR) generated by the new coil were then compared with the TEM and 16-channel Tic Tac coils using Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations. Preliminary data shows significant improvements in all of performance parameters: coefficient of variation (CV) = 14.9% ( field distribution) and maximum/minimum (Max/Min) = 2.45 ( field intensity) across the whole head above and including the cerebellum; and peak/average SAR = 4.97/1.51 W/Kg/10g.</p>

								<!--<p>This work proposes four optimization strategies for the RF shimming in UHF MRI. The results show a minimum coefficient of variation of B1+ field distribution over the human head = 23%/17%/14% for the 4chTEM, 16chTTT, and 64chTTT respectively. For the maximum over minimum evaluation criteria of the B1+ field distribution, the best values were 6.70/2.92/2.23 for 4chTEM/16chTTT/64chTTT coils. For a fixed mean B1+ field over the human head, the best average SAR values were 2.09/1.28W/kg for the 4chTEM/16chTTT coils respectively. These strategies can be applied to any RF transmit array system, but are most beneficial for highly parallel systems.</p>-->

									<h3><font color = "FFDF8A">How My Life has Shaped My Dreams and Aspirations...</font></h3>
									<p>Growing up with a doctor as my parent, I spent many hours roaming the halls and rooms of the hospital. The smell of disinfectant was the scent of my childhood. The sight of needles and patients with all kind of illness were just familiar sights of my normal days. Having spent so many hours of my life in the hospital, I naturally feel a strong sense of belonging there. And further inspired by the healing miracles, I was determined to have a career in the medical field.</i></font></p>
									<p>With all the interests in the medical field, my life was always revolved around science. In fact, my life is somewhat every scientific. Every school year, I would set a specific goal to reach a certain grade percentile in the class, for example to reach between the top 1% percentiles, and I did achieve all my goals.</i></font></p>
									<p>As for the academic subjects, my first favorite class was computer programming. I was very into learning about computer and its language that I was recruited by the Computer Science Education Gifted Center during eighth grade. At the center, I took advance programming courses and created my own program using SQL and Visual Basic that was designed to help students learn chemistry by showing chemical formula when the users click on elements they want in a reaction.</i></font></p>
									<p>After my brief experience at the center, I was recruited by Seoul Science Park Gifted Education Center which provided me with even more advance science and mathematics courses. Then, I came to the United States and graduated Missouri Academy, an early-entrance-to-college-school where all classes were taught in college and concentrated in STEM field.</i></font></p>
									<p>All these experiences solidified my interest in engineering and shaped my education approach. Specifically, I wanted to combine my interest in the medical field with engineering. It simply concluded that Biomedical Engineering was the perfect path, and this led me to attend University of Pittsburgh’s BME program.</i></font></p>
									<p>At University of Pittsburgh, I am currently developing a software for Multi-Channel RF Coils optimization at the 7 Tesla Human Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Lab. Here, I also had an utter privilege to become a co-author of a research paper published at the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine. In addition, I had an opportunity to work at the leading global healthcare company, Siemens Healthineers, during the Summer.</i></font></p>
									<p>It may seem like my life has been carefully planned, and yes, I agree. The reason for it is simple: I am determined to achieve my dream of being the most authoritative radiologist and a biomedical engineer. My future plan is to attend Korean Medical School after graduation and achieve Doctor of Medicine. After attaining MD, my dream is to attend MIT’s Biomedical Engineering PhD program and either go into biomedical industries or become a radiology professor. Eventually, my final goal is to become the first Korean ever to achieve Novel Medicine Prize. This dream of mine is the culmination of all my experiences and thus, one of my strongest motivations.</i></font></p>
